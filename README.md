# CIS 5 Assignment 4 – Employee Performance Scores

## Program Goal
This C++ program manages 10 employee performance scores (0–100) using functions with pass by value, pass by reference, and pointers.  
It demonstrates how to calculate the sum and average, add bonus points, find the minimum score, and count high performers.

## Features
- Displays the original employee scores.
- Calculates the **sum** and **average** of the scores.
- Adds a **bonus of 10 points** to all scores and displays the updated scores.
- Finds the **minimum score** after the bonus is applied.
- Counts the number of **high performers (score ≥ 80)**.

## Array of Scores
```cpp
int ary[10] = {75, 88, 62, 95, 50, 82, 70, 91, 45, 78};
